⚙️ STM32F401RE Driver Development

📌 Overview

This repository contains custom drivers developed for the STM32F401RE microcontroller. These drivers are written in C and designed to interface directly with low-level hardware registers, providing greater control and understanding of peripheral operation.

🧰 Technologies Used

Microcontroller: STM32F401RE (ARM Cortex-M4)

Programming Language: C

Toolchain: STM32CubeIDE or Keil uVision (optional)

Debugging: ST-Link/V2, OpenOCD

🧩 Features

Low-level peripheral access

Modular and reusable code

Documentation and comments for educational clarity

🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Prerequisites

STM32F401RE board (e.g. Nucleo-F401RE)

STM32CubeIDE or any ARM-GCC toolchain

Basic knowledge of embedded C

2️⃣ How to Use

Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g. STM32CubeIDE).
